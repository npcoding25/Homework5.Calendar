# Day Planner

## Objective

* Create an hourly day planner where you can write and save tasks

## Functionality

When opening up the day planner you will be given the current date and time thanks to moment.js. There is 10 time slots, 9AM - 6PM, where you can type what you need to do during that hour. The colours of each time slot is determined by comparing it to real time with moment.js. When you click the save icon on the right side the data is stored in localStorage. If you leave the page and come back your data will be still be shown.

## Challenges & Improvements

I've had a lot of troubles with localStorage but I think it's finally set in. Figuring out moment.js took a little time but wasn't too bad. Using moment.js to determine different colours was tough though. I couldn't figure out how to loop my functions properly at first but I found after just figuring out one button it was easier to figure out the loop. I would have liked to loop the save buttons and their functions somehow but I couldn't figure that out.
